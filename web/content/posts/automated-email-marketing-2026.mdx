## Actionable Python Code: Building Your Automated Campaigns

This section will provide practical Python code examples for common email marketing automation tasks.

### 1. Sending a Simple Email

This foundational script demonstrates how to send a basic email using Python's `smtplib`.

```python
import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText

sender_email = "your_email@gmail.com"
receiver_email = "recipient_email@example.com"
password = "your_app_password"  # Use an app-specific password for security

message = MIMEText("This is a test email sent from Python.")
message["Subject"] = "Python Email Test"
message["From"] = sender_email
message["To"] = receiver_email

try:
    with smtplib.SMTP_SSL("smtp.gmail.com", 465) as server:
        server.login(sender_email, password)
        server.sendmail(sender_email, receiver_email, message.as_string())
    print("Email sent successfully!")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error sending email: {e}")
```
*Note: For Gmail, you'll need to enable "Less secure app access" or, preferably, generate an "App password" for enhanced security.*

### 2. Personalized Email with Jinja2 Templates

Utilize Jinja2 for creating dynamic email templates with personalized content.

First, install Jinja2: `pip install Jinja2`

Create a template file (e.g., `template.html`):
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Welcome!</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>Hello {{ name }},</p>
    <p>Welcome to our service! We're excited to have you.</p>
    <p>Here's a special offer just for you: {{ offer }}</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Then, use this Python script:
```python
import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
from jinja2 import Environment, FileSystemLoader

# Email credentials and details
sender_email = "your_email@gmail.com"
password = "your_app_password"

# Jinja2 environment setup
env = Environment(loader=FileSystemLoader('.')) # Looks for templates in the current directory
template = env.get_template("template.html")

# Contact data
contacts = [
    {"name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com", "offer": "10% off your first purchase"},
    {"name": "Bob", "email": "bob@example.com", "offer": "Free shipping on all orders"}
]

for contact in contacts:
    try:
        # Render the template with personalized data
        html_content = template.render(name=contact["name"], offer=contact["offer"])
        message = MIMEText(html_content, 'html')
        message["Subject"] = f"Welcome, {contact['name']}!"
        message["From"] = sender_email
        message["To"] = contact["email"]

        with smtplib.SMTP_SSL("smtp.gmail.com", 465) as server:
            server.login(sender_email, password)
            server.sendmail(sender_email, contact["email"], message.as_string())
        print(f"Welcome email sent to {contact['name']} ({contact['email']})")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error sending email to {contact['email']}: {e}")
```

### 3. Scheduling Emails with `schedule`

Automate the sending of emails at specific times using the `schedule` library.

First, install `schedule`: `pip install schedule`

```python
import schedule
import time
import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText

def send_scheduled_email():
    # Reuse the sending logic from the simple email example
    sender_email = "your_email@gmail.com"
    receiver_email = "recipient_email@example.com"
    password = "your_app_password"

    message = MIMEText("This is a scheduled email.")
    message["Subject"] = "Scheduled Python Email"
    message["From"] = sender_email
    message["To"] = receiver_email

    try:
        with smtplib.SMTP_SSL("smtp.gmail.com", 465) as server:
            server.login(sender_email, password)
            server.sendmail(sender_email, receiver_email, message.as_string())
        print("Scheduled email sent successfully!")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error sending scheduled email: {e}")

# Schedule the job to run every day at 10:30 AM
schedule.every().day.at("10:30").do(send_scheduled_email)

# Schedule the job to run every Monday
schedule.every().monday.do(send_scheduled_email)

# Schedule the job to run every hour
schedule.every().hour.do(send_scheduled_email)

while True:
    schedule.run_pending()
    time.sleep(1)
```

## Data Management with Pandas for Segmentation

Efficiently manage your contact lists and segment them for targeted campaigns using the `pandas` library.

### 1. Reading Contacts from a CSV

```python
import pandas as pd

try:
    df = pd.read_csv("contacts.csv")
    print("Contacts loaded successfully:")
    print(df.head())

    # Example: Filter contacts for a specific segment (e.g., based on 'city')
    london_contacts = df[df['city'] == 'London']
    print("\nContacts in London:")
    print(london_contacts)

except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: contacts.csv not found. Please create the file with your contact data.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```Your `contacts.csv` could look like this:
```csv
name,email,city,interests
Alice,alice@example.com,London,Technology
Bob,bob@example.com,New York,Travel
Charlie,charlie@example.com,London,Finance
David,david@example.com,Paris,Technology
```

## Advanced Automation: Behavioral Triggers and Analytics

Python can also be used to implement more sophisticated automation, such as behavioral triggers and basic analytics.

### 1. Behavioral Trigger (Conceptual Example)

This example outlines how you might trigger an email based on a customer's behavior, such as abandoning their shopping cart. The actual implementation would depend on your e-commerce platform's API and your ability to track customer actions.

```python
import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText

def send_abandoned_cart_email(customer_email, cart_contents):
    # Email sending logic similar to previous examples
    sender_email = "your_email@gmail.com"
    password = "your_app_password"
    message = MIMEText(f"Dear customer, you left {cart_contents} in your cart.")
    message["Subject"] = "Complete Your Purchase"
    message["From"] = sender_email
    message["To"] = customer_email

    try:
        with smtplib.SMTP_SSL("smtp.gmail.com", 465) as server:
            server.login(sender_email, password)
            server.sendmail(sender_email, customer_email, message.as_string())
        print("Abandoned cart email sent successfully!")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error sending abandoned cart email: {e}")

# Simulated customer behavior data
customer_email = "customer@example.com"
cart_contents = "Product A, Product B"

# Trigger the email
send_abandoned_cart_email(customer_email, cart_contents)
```

### 2. Basic Analytics with Python

For basic analytics, such as tracking email opens or clicks, you can use libraries like `matplotlib` or `seaborn` for visualization and `pandas` for data manipulation.

First, install necessary libraries: `pip install matplotlib seaborn pandas`

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Simulated email analytics data
data = {
    'Email Campaign': ['Campaign 1', 'Campaign 2', 'Campaign 3'],
    'Opens': [100, 120, 90],
    'Clicks': [20, 25, 18]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Basic bar chart for email opens
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
sns.countplot(x='Email Campaign', data=df)
plt.title('Email Opens by Campaign')
plt.show()

# Basic line chart for email clicks
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
sns.lineplot(x='Email Campaign', y='Clicks', data=df)
plt.title('Email Clicks by Campaign')
plt.show()
```

By leveraging these Python libraries and scripts, you can automate and enhance your email marketing campaigns, leading to more personalized customer interactions and improved ROI. Remember, the key to successful automation is understanding your audience and continuously refining your strategies based on data-driven insights.
